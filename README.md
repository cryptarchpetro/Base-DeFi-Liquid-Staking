Base DeFi Liquid Staking
📋 Project Description
Base DeFi Liquid Staking is a decentralized finance protocol that allows users to stake their tokens and earn passive income while maintaining liquidity. This innovative approach combines the benefits of traditional staking with the flexibility of liquid staking tokens.

🔧 Technologies Used
Programming Language: Solidity 0.8.0
Framework: Hardhat
Network: Base Network
Standards: ERC-20

💰 Features
Core Functionality:
✅ Token staking with liquid rewards
✅ Liquid staking tokens (LSTs)
✅ Flexible staking periods
✅ Automated reward distribution
✅ Withdrawal flexibility
✅ Real-time reward calculation
Advanced Features:
Liquid Staking Tokens - ERC-20 tokens representing staked assets
Dynamic APR - Variable annual percentage rates
Multi-Asset Support - Support for various token types
Governance Integration - Staking-weighted governance
Risk Management - Built-in risk assessment tools
Liquidity Provision - Integrated liquidity features
🛠️ Smart Contract Functions
Core Functions:
stake(address token, uint256 amount, uint256 duration) - Stake tokens for specified duration
unstake(address token, uint256 amount) - Withdraw staked tokens
claimRewards(address token) - Claim accumulated rewards
redeemLST(address lstToken, uint256 amount) - Redeem liquid staking tokens
getStakingInfo(address user, address token) - Get user staking information
calculateRewards(address user, address token) - Calculate pending rewards
Events:
Staked - Emitted when tokens are staked
Unstaked - Emitted when tokens are unstaked
RewardsClaimed - Emitted when rewards are claimed
LSTRedeemed - Emitted when LSTs are redeemed
StakingParametersUpdated - Emitted when staking parameters are updated
RewardCompounded - Emitted when rewards are compounded
